# Exploring-Databases-and-Queries

In the SQL lab, I showcased data querying and manipulation skills, handling offices, employees, and customers. Tasks included extracting information for 
Paris and Canada customers, identifying payments, and calculating product markups. I successfully executed inserts, updates, and deletes, demonstrating 
proficiency in SQL fundamentals and relational database management.
